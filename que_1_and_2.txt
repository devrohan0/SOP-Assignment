Que1) Explain Rules For Declaring Variables in C.

Variable names can only contain letters (uppercase or lowercase), digits (0-9), and underscore (_). The first character of a variable name must be a letter or underscore.

Variable names cannot be the same as keywords or predefined identifiers in C.

Variable names are case-sensitive, which means that "count" and "Count" are two different variables.

Variables must be declared before they are used in the program.

The syntax for declaring a variable is: data_type variable_name;

Multiple variables of the same data type can be declared in a single line by separating them with commas. For example: int x, y, z;

Variables can be assigned an initial value when they are declared. For example: int x = 10;

It is possible to declare a variable without assigning an initial value. In this case, the variable will contain a random value until it is assigned a value explicitly.

Variables can be declared at the beginning of a block of code, such as a function, or within the block itself.

The scope of a variable is the area of the program where it can be accessed. A variable declared within a block of code can only be accessed within that block.

Que2)  Explain all Data Types with their ranges, and how they are declared in C.


     In C programming language, there are several data types that are used o define variables, each with different ranges and storage sizes.
     Here are the most commonly used data types in C, along with their ranges and how they are declared:

     1) char: This data type is used to store single characters or small integers. It is declared as follows:
          The range of char data type is from -128 to 127, or from 0 to 255 if unsigned.
          char character_variable = 'a';
 
     2) int: This data type is used to store integers. It is declared as follows
              The range of int data type is from -2147483648 to 2147483647.

     3)    int - Used to store integers (whole numbers) that can be either positive or negative. The range of the int data type is typically from -32,768 to 32,767 on 16-bit machines, and from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 on 32-bit machines.

      4) float - Used to store single-precision floating-point numbers, which are numbers with a fractional part. The range of the float data type is typically from 1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38, with a precision of 6 decimal places.

     5) double - Used to store double-precision floating-point numbers, which are numbers with a fractional part and higher precision than float. The range of the double data type is typically from 2.3E-308 to 1.7E+308, with a precision of 15 decimal places.

    6) void - Used to indicate that a function or pointer does not return a value or to declare a generic pointer.

     7) short - Used to store smaller integers than int, typically from -32,768 to 32,767.

     8) long - Used to store larger integers than int, typically from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

      9) unsigned - Used to store only positive values of the int, short, or long data types.
